# Vulnerability Detection with Fine-grained Interpretations

<p aligh="center"> This repository contains the code and data for <b>Vulnerability Detection with Fine-grained Interpretations</b> </p>

##Introduction##

Despite the successes of machine learning-based vulnerability detectors (VD), they are limited to providing only the decision on whether a given code is vulnerable or not, without details on what part of the code is relevant to the detected vulnerability. We present IVDetect, an interpretable vulnerability detector with the philosophy of using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to detect vulnerabilities, while using Intelligence Assistant (IA) via providing VD interpretations
at the fine-grained level in term of vulnerable statements. For vulnerability detection, we separately consider the vulnerable statements and their surrounding contexts via data and control dependencies. This allows our model better discriminate vulnerable statements than using the mixture of vulnerable code and contextual code as in existing approaches. In addition to the coarsegrained vulnerability detection result, we leverage interpretable ML to provide users with fine-grained interpretations that include the sub-graph in the PDG with the crucial statements that are relevant to the detected vulnerability. Our empirical evaluation on vulnerability databases shows that IVDetect outperforms the existing ML-based approaches 64–122% and 105–255% in top-10 nDCG and MAP ranking scores. IVDetect correctly points out the vulnerable statements relevant to the vulnerability via its interpretations in 67% of the cases with a top-5 ranked list. It improves over ATT and GRAD interpretation models by 12.3–400% and 9–400% in accuracy.

## Dataset

The Dataset we used in the paper:

Fan et al.[1]: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-0VhnHBp9IGh90s2wCNjeCMuy70HPl8X/view?usp=sharing

Reveal [2]: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KuIYgFcvWUXheDhT--cBALsfy1I4utOy

FFMPeg+Qemu [3]: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x6hoF7G-tSYxg8AFybggypLZgMGDNHfF

Please download all dataset into the folder ```\data```, and please do not change the default file name in order to make the preprocess step can work.

## Requirement

Please check all requirements in the requirement.txt

## Editable-Parameters

1. In the source code, we use ```os.environ["CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES"]``` to control the GPU we want to use to run the deep learning model. So if you have multiple GPUs to use and want to control which GPU you want to use, please change the GPU number in this command in the source code.

2. The parameter ```joern_home``` in the ```preprocess.py``` need to be changed to the address that you install the joern to make the preprocess code work.
